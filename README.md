# GrTree

A simple tree writen in angular.

## Setup

A simple `npm install` should install all dev and non dev dependencies.

Then you need to run the following **if you do not have these globally installed**:

* `npm link gulp` - links gulp to the current directory

Then you can run `gulp` and the sources will be generated at the `./build` folder.
